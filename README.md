# libhlusbd - High Level USB Device Library 

State: ALPHA / Work in Progress / Not feature complete

This is a high level USB Device library. This implements the USB protocol,
and requires some low level device specific implementation to interface with.

It comes with some drivers to interface with the STM32CubeF1 HAL, and nrfx
will be added soon.
